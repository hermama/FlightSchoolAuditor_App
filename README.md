# Module that validates the flight school's records.
eCornell CIS556 Final Project

This is the primary module that does all of the work. It loads the files, loops through
the lessons, and searches for any takeoffs that violate insurance requirements.

__main__.py is the main module of this application that calls all of the functions found in 
the imported modules.
