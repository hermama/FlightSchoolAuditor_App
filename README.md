Module that validates the flight school's records.

This is the primary module that does all of the work. It loads the files, loops through
the lessons, and searches for any takeoffs that violate insurance requirements.

Technically, we could have put many of these functions in __main__.py.  That is the
main module of this application anyway.  However, for testing purposes we want all
functions in modules and we only want script code in the file __main__.py
